# SMS-APPLICATION-USING-NODEJS
SMS Application is designed using Node.js,Express.js,MongoDB .Nexmo API is used to send SMS to nearly any part of the world.

-I have created this project to make my learning fun.When I started learning JS then I was amused by how a bulb can be turned ON/OFF just by click off the button using Javascript.

-In this project,I am sending SMS to a particular mobile phone using Nexmo API.

**Features**
1.Nexmo SMS API allows developers to integrate their applications with the Nexmo SMS services, allows its users to send and receive messages through Nexmo directly from their applications. 

2.Only the persons who are logged in to the application are allowed to send the text message to the phone.

3.User can only login in to the application only if he is registered.

4.Sessions are implemented in the application to keep track of user's activity.

- Your details will be saved in the database.I have used mLAB as a cloud database service.It provides us the set of tools to host MongoDB database.

-Our details are now stored in database

-Now we can enter the mobile number to which we want to send SMS ,keep in mind that the number should be registered with the Nexmo,only then we will be able to send SMS to it.It will charge us few rupees to send SMS but we are using Nexmo API for only testing purpose so cost would be very less.Nexmo gives you 2 Euros when you first use their service .I am making good use of it :)
